# Notes App
This is a project management app built using React for the frontend and Django for the backend. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes related to their projects. The app is built with a responsive and intuitive user interface using React and a robust backend using Django and Django Rest Framework.

Future plans for this app include upgrading it with data science tools for self-prediction features to help users better manage their projects. These features will be added gradually as the project progresses.
